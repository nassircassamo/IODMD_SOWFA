## Thesis Abstract
Sitting wind turbines together in wind farms is economically advantageous. However, as the first turbine extracts energy from the wind, less power is available for downstream turbines. Current industry practices neglect the aerodynamic interaction, optimizing only at the individual turbine level, which leads to suboptimal behaviour of the total wind farm. Controlling wind farms as a whole is becoming increasingly important. Nevertheless, due to the fact that wind farms are high order systems whose dynamics are governed by nonlinear partial differential equations with no known analytical solution, the design and implementation of numerical optimal controllers in high fidelity simulators becomes computationally expensive and unsuitable for real time usage. Reduce order state models provide a possible route to the design and implementation of practical cooperative wind farm controllers. This thesis makes use of an innovative algorithm in the context of wind farm modelling - Input Output Dynamic Mode Decomposition - and the ideas of non linear dynamical system theory - the Koopman Operator - to find suitable reduced order models to be used for model predictive control. The wind farm control strategy of wake redirection control is studied. It is shown that a reduced state space model with 37 states can accurately reproduce the downstream turbine generator power dynamics with a variance accounted for of 88%, rebuild the upstream turbine wake with an average normalized root mean squared error of 4% and that controllers can be designed and implemented in a high fidelity simulator for a collective power reference tracking problem.
