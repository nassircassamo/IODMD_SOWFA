## Data repository

Two different folders exist in the link, corresponding to two different datasets where two distinct wind farm control strategies are tested:

1. *pitch_control*: axial induction control is used as a wind farm control strategy. Wind turbine blades are collectively pitched. In this directory, two additional folders and two additional files are present:
	1.1. *steps_theta_col_new*
	1.2. *steps_theta_col_new_val*
	1.3. *U_data_complete_vec_pulse_val.mat*
	1.4.

2. *yaw_control*: a yaw control strategy is used: wake redirection control is used as a wind farm control strategy. The wind turbine tower nacelle is yawed. Similarly to pitch control, in this directory two additional folders and two additional files are present:
	1.1.
	1.2.
	1.3.
	1.4.
