%% Installation
% The version 2.2 of the LTI System Identificantion Toolbox is recommended
% with Matlab 7.4 (R2007A) or higher. Although Matlab 7.1, 7.0, 6.5 and 5
% should also work (except the compilation mex-files). The m-files should
% work on all platforms. The mex-files can be compiled under Windows, Mac
% and Linux, other platforms have not been checked.
%
% * Download and unzip the LTIToolbox-2.2.zip in a directory. If you
%  upgrade from an older version, first empty the previous directory.
%
% * Run |ltisetup| to add the directory to the path and compile the mex
% files.
%
% * Restart Matlab. From the Start button, select Toolboxes > LTI System
% Identification Toolbox to check that the toolbox is correctly recognized
% by your system.
%
% * If you upgrade from an earlier version, type rehash toolbox to make
% sure that Matlab refreshes the function cache.
%
% * Run the m-file |ltidemo|, to look if the functions are running
% correctly.
