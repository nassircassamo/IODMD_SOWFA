            <p>The LTI System Identification Toolbox for Matlab enables you to perform an identification of linear time-invariant systems.
               It provides command-line functions for parametric model estimation and subspace model identification in both discrete-time

         <h2>Subspace Identification using PI-MOESP<a name="1"></a></h2>
         <p>In this example we will give an example of how the subspace identification framework in the toolbox software is used in a
            practical situation. The PI-MOESP scheme functions <a href="dordpi.html"><tt>dordpi</tt></a> and <a href="dmodpi.html"><tt>dmodpi</tt></a> will be used to estimate <i>A</i> and <i>C</i>, after which <a href="dac2bd.html"><tt>dac2bd</tt></a> and <a href="dinit.html"><tt>dinit</tt></a> are used to estimate <i>B</i>, <i>D</i> and the initial state. Finally, a simple model validation is performed.
         </p>
         <p>First we generate data for a second-order system. Apseudorandom binary sequence will be generated as identification input
            using the tool <a href="prbn.html"><tt>prbn</tt></a>. A pseudo-random binary sequence, or PRBN, is an often-used identification input signal. In the following example, the <tt>rate</tt> is set to 0.1 in order to get a signal that changes state rather infrequently and which therefore mainly contains signal
            energy in the lower frequency range.
         </p><pre class="codeinput">A = [1.5 -0.7; 1 0]; B = [1; 0]; C = [1 0.5]; D = 0;
u = prbn(300,0.1)-0.5;
y = dltisim(A,B,C,D,u);
</pre><p>In order to make the example more realistic, the output signal is disturbed by colored measurement noise such that a 20 dB
            SNR is obtained. The <tt>b</tt> and <tt>a</tt> vectors correspond to the numerator and denominator polynomials of a lowpass filter.
         </p><pre class="codeinput">b = [0.17 0.50 0.50 0.17];
a = [1.0 0 0.33 0];
y = y + 0.1*std(y)*filter(b,a,randn(300,1));

         <p>This model, in which <i>v(k)</i> is a colored noise signal, falls within the class of models for which PI-MOESP can provide consistent estimates, as was illustrated
            in Section 9.5 of the textbook.
         </p>
         <h2>Step 1: Data Compression and Order Estimation<a name="4"></a></h2>
         <p>In this first step we use the "ord" function, <a href="dordpi.html"><tt>dordpi</tt></a> in this PI-MOESP case, in order to compress the available data and to generate a model order estimate. The only model structure
            selection parameter that we need to pass is the block-size <tt>s</tt>, which should be larger than the expected system order. We will use the rather high value <tt>s=10</tt> in this example in order to show the order selection mechanism more clearly.
         </p><pre class="codeinput">s = 10;
[S,R] = dordpi(u,y,s);
</pre><p>The function <a href="dordpi.html"><tt>dordpi</tt></a> returns a vector <tt>S</tt> containing singular values based on which the model order can be determined. In addition, a compressed data matrix <tt>R</tt> is returned that is used by <a href="dmodpi.html"><tt>dmodpi</tt></a> to estimate <i>A</i> and <i>C</i> in the next step. The singular values in <tt>S</tt> are plotted using the following command:
         </p><pre class="codeinput">figure, semilogy(1:10,S,<span class="string">'x'</span>)
</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="lti_gettingstarted_02.png"> <p>In a noise-free case, only the first <tt>n</tt> singular values would have been nonzero. However, the singular values that would have been zero are now disturbed because
            of the noise. Still, a gap is visible between singular values 2 and 3, and so the model order will be chosen equal to <tt>n=2</tt>.
         </p>
         <h2>Step 2: Estimation of A and C<a name="7"></a></h2>
         <p>In this step we will obtain estimates for <i>A</i> and <i>C</i>. As the <i>A</i> and <i>C</i> variables have already been defined, we will call the estimates for <i>A</i> and <i>C</i>, <tt>Ae</tt> and <tt>Ce</tt> respectively. The function <a href="dordpi.html"><tt>dordpi</tt></a> is used to determine <tt>Ae</tt> and <tt>Ce</tt> based on the <tt>R</tt> matrix from dordpi and the model order n determined from the singular value plot.

%% Getting Started
% The LTI System Identification Toolbox for Matlab enables you to perform 
% an identification of linear time-invariant systems. It provides
% command-line functions for parametric model estimation and subspace model
% identification in both discrete-time and continuous-time (frequency 
% domain). To get you started, this page will explain a subspace
% identification of a small LTI model using the PI-MOESP method. For more
% examples and a full description of the <lti_func_cat.html functions>,
% read the toolbox software <../companion.pdf manual>. 

%% Subspace Identification using PI-MOESP
% In this example we will give an example of how the subspace
% identification framework in the toolbox software is used in a practical
% situation. The PI-MOESP scheme functions <dordpi.html |dordpi|> and
% <dmodpi.html |dmodpi|> will be used to estimate _A_ and _C_, after which
% <dac2bd.html |dac2bd|> and <dinit.html |dinit|> are used to estimate _B_,
% _D_ and the initial state. Finally, a simple model validation is
% performed.
%
% First we generate data for a second-order system. Apseudorandom binary
% sequence will be generated as identification input using the tool
% <prbn.html |prbn|>. A pseudo-random binary sequence, or PRBN, is an
% often-used identification input signal. In the following example, the
% |rate| is set to 0.1 in order to get a signal that changes state rather
% infrequently and which therefore mainly contains signal energy in the
% lower frequency range.

A = [1.5 -0.7; 1 0]; B = [1; 0]; C = [1 0.5]; D = 0;
u = prbn(300,0.1)-0.5;
y = dltisim(A,B,C,D,u);

%%
% In order to make the example more realistic, the output signal is
% disturbed by colored measurement noise such that a 20 dB SNR is obtained.
% The |b| and |a| vectors correspond to the numerator and denominator
% polynomials of a lowpass filter.

b = [0.17 0.50 0.50 0.17];
a = [1.0 0 0.33 0];
y = y + 0.1*std(y)*filter(b,a,randn(300,1));

subplot(2,1,2);
plot(1:300,y);

xlabel('Sample')

%%
% We will now try to identify the system from the generated data set by
% assuming the following state-space model structure:
% 
% $$x(k + 1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k), x(0) = x0$$
% 
% $$y(k) = Cx(k) + Du(k) + v(k)$$
% 
% This model, in which _v(k)_ is a colored noise signal, falls within the
% class of models for which PI-MOESP can provide consistent estimates, as
% was illustrated in Section 9.5 of the textbook. 

%% Step 1: Data Compression and Order Estimation
% In this first step we use the "ord" function, <dordpi.html |dordpi|> in
% this PI-MOESP case, in order to compress the available data and to
% generate a model order estimate. The only model structure selection
% parameter that we need to pass is the block-size |s|, which should be
% larger than the expected system order. We will use the rather high value
% |s=10| in this example in order to show the order selection mechanism
% more clearly.

s = 10;
[S,R] = dordpi(u,y,s);

%%
% The function <dordpi.html |dordpi|> returns a vector |S| containing
% singular values based on which the model order can be determined. In
% addition, a compressed data matrix |R| is returned that is used by
% <dmodpi.html |dmodpi|> to estimate _A_ and _C_ in the next step. The
% singular values in |S| are plotted using the following command:

figure, semilogy(1:10,S,'x')

%%
% In a noise-free case, only the first |n| singular values would have been
% nonzero. However, the singular values that would have been zero are now
% disturbed because of the noise. Still, a gap is visible between singular
% values 2 and 3, and so the model order will be chosen equal to |n=2|.

%% Step 2: Estimation of A and C
% In this step we will obtain estimates for _A_ and _C_. As the _A_ and _C_
% variables have already been defined, we will call the estimates for _A_
% and _C_, |Ae| and |Ce| respectively. The function <dordpi.html |dordpi|>
% is used to determine |Ae| and |Ce| based on the |R| matrix from dordpi
% and the model order n determined from the singular value plot.

n = 2;
[Ae,Ce] = dmodpi(R,n);

%% Step 3: Estimation of B, D and the Initial State
% Once estimates |Ae| and |Ce| for _A_ and _C_ have been determined, the
% toolbox function <dac2bd.html |dac2bd|> will be used to estimate _B_ and
% _D_, as |Be| and |De| respectively. The function <dac2bd.html |dac2bd|>
% requires the estimates for _A_ and _C_ and the measured inputoutput data.
% Subsequently, the toolbox function <dinit.html |dinit|> is used to obtain
% the initial state |x0| corresponding to the current data set. This
% function needs estimates for all system matrices as well as the measured
% input-output data.

[Be,De] = dac2bd(Ae,Ce,u,y);
x0e = dinit(Ae,Be,Ce,De,u,y);

%% Model Validaton
% The quality of the model |(Ae,Be,Ce,De)| that has been identified will
% now be assessed. To this end, we will compare the output predicted by the
% identified model to the measured output signal. As a figure of merit, we
% use the variance accounted for (VAF). If the model is good, the VAF
% should be close to 100%. The following code fragment simulated the
% estimated model using the measured input signal in order to obtain the
% estimated output |ye|. Subsequently, the VAF is calculated using the
% toolbox function  <vaf.html |vaf|>.

ye = dltisim(Ae,Be,Ce,De,u,x0e);
vaf(y,ye)

%%
% It is clear that the estimated model described the actual system behavior well.
% The error signal _y(k)_ - _ye(k)_ is plotted. This error is very small
% compared to the output signal in the first figure.
